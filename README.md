![A split face image](doubles/resize_IMG_8725.png?raw=true "Split face image")
A simple script for revealing the asymmetry in faces. It is mostly automated with a manual step for finding the middle of a face in the photo, its middle pizel.  Take a well lit, straight on photo of a face, put it in the example/ folder, open the photo in a photoviewer with coordinates to pick the pixel closest to the middle of the face, modify halves.csv with one line per photo, and the x-coordinate of the halfway point you found, install the dependences, run the script, and get dual portraits.

The examples folder gives examples of good and bad (head with tilt, yaw, or roll;bad light; bad facial expression) source photos. Most of the success of this is getting the photos right, so take several of each subject. Good cues are to imagine a string pulling the top of the head straight up into the air, and a laster coming out of the nose point right into the middle of the lens (or lenses on a phone).
